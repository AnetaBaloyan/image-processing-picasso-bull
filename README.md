# Obtaining Picasso's bull transformations
This repository contains my final project for **_CS260 Image Processing_** course. 

In this project, I am going to use different image processing techniques (to be specified later) to obtain the transformations that Picasso obtained creating his famous [bull plates](https://www.widewalls.ch/magazine/pablo-picaso-bull-plates). In particular, I am going to work on two transitions: transition from plate **3 to 4** and transition from plate **9 to 10 (the final plate)**. 

You can find all the plates in the **_/Picasso_bull_plates_** directory.
